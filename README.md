🌱 Sustellix: AI-Driven Sustainable Resource Management System for Campuses  

Project Overview  
Sustellix (Sustainability + Intelligence + X) is an intelligent resource management platform designed to optimize electricity, water, and waste consumption across campus hostels. By integrating AI/ML models with a full-stack web application, the system analyzes historical data, predicts trends, and incentivizes sustainable practices through dynamic rankings, cost-saving redistribution, and actionable insights.

### Key Features  
🔍 AI-Powered Analytics  
- Predicts future electricity/water usage using regression models and detects anomalies.  
- Clusters hostels by consumption patterns to tailor sustainability strategies.  

🏆 Dynamic Hostel Rankings  
- Ranks hostels based on per capita efficiency metrics (electricity, water, waste).  
- Updates monthly leaderboards to foster competition and transparency.  

💸 Reward Optimization  
- Reinvests cost savings (from reduced bills) into hostel facilities using reinforcement learning.  
- Prioritizes upgrades like gym equipment based on student preferences.  

📊 Automated Sustainability Reports  
- Generates monthly reports with visualizations (Chart.js/D3.js) to track progress.  

🤝 Collaborative Challenges  
- Tracks inter-hostel sustainability goals (e.g., "Reduce energy by 15%") via real-time dashboards.

### Workflow  
1. Data Upload: Hostel caretakers submit monthly consumption data via web forms.  
2. AI Analysis: Models generate predictions, anomalies, and efficiency scores.  
3. Rankings & Rewards: Hostels are ranked, and savings are redistributed.  
4. Reports & Dashboards: Administrators access insights to drive decisions.

### Why Sustellix?  
- Reduce Waste: Cut campus resource consumption by up to 30% with AI-driven insights.  
- Save Costs: Reinvest financial savings into student facilities.  
- Encourage Accountability: Transparent rankings and gamified challenges promote student/staff engagement.  
- Scalable: Designed for easy adoption across universities or corporate campuses.
